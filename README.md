# Progressive webapp with React, Spring Boot, MySQL and many more

Hi there! This app is an example application for end to end runing application with React, Spring Boot, MySql, Swagger, liquibase etc.
I've tried to use most of the technologies and various java features.

This app is working with Java 11.

## The purpose of the webapp

The purpose of the app was to learn as to : 

 1. How to build Spring Boot apps?
 2. How to build React apps?
 3. How to encapsulate the backend to the frontend?
 4. How to deploy React and Spring Boot along with MySQL DB in my server?
 5. How to use swagger2 to document and use your REST APIs

### Installation

You'll need maven, npm and JAVA pre-installed, which most probably you'll already have.  To run the application, run the following commands from the console.

```sh
$ mvn clean
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/aanchal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
